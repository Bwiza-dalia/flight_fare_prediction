# flight_fare_prediction
The objective of this project is to forecast flight ticket prices using machine learning. To accomplish this, the project will utilize historical flight data, including departure date, airline, and ticket prices, to train predictive models. The end goal is to create a model that can accurately predict future flight ticket prices, benefiting both airlines and consumers by helping airlines set prices more effectively and allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. Different machine learning algorithms will be compared to find the best performing model, which will be evaluated using accuracy and error metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error. The project is intended to make air travel more affordable and accessible by providing valuable insights for all parties involved.
